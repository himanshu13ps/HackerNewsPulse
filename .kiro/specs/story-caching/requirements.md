# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements intelligent caching for Hacker News stories to improve user experience by reducing network calls and providing instant content when switching between story categories. The caching system will preload the first page of both top stories and new stories on app startup, maintain cache consistency with user interactions, and provide seamless category switching.

## Glossary

- **Story_Cache_System**: The in-memory caching mechanism that stores story data for quick retrieval
- **Story_Category**: Either "top stories" or "new stories" as selectable content types
- **Cache_Preload**: The process of loading initial story data into cache during app startup
- **Pull_To_Refresh**: User gesture that triggers content refresh and cache invalidation
- **Category_Selector**: UI component allowing users to switch between top and new stories
- **Pagination_Load**: Loading additional stories when user scrolls to load more content

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want the app to preload story data on startup, so that I can immediately see content without waiting for network calls.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app starts, THE Story_Cache_System SHALL preload the first page of top stories data
2. WHEN the app starts, THE Story_Cache_System SHALL preload the first page of new stories data
3. THE Story_Cache_System SHALL complete cache preloading as early as possible in the app startup phase
4. THE Story_Cache_System SHALL store preloaded data in memory for immediate access
5. THE Story_Cache_System SHALL maintain separate cache storage for each Story_Category

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to switch between story categories instantly, so that I can browse different content types without delays.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN user selects a different Story_Category, THE Story_Cache_System SHALL check for cached data first
2. IF cached data exists for the selected Story_Category, THEN THE Story_Cache_System SHALL render content from cache without network calls
3. WHEN user switches Story_Category, THE Story_Cache_System SHALL not modify existing cache data
4. THE Story_Cache_System SHALL preserve cache data for both Story_Category types during category switching
5. THE Story_Cache_System SHALL provide immediate content display when switching to a cached Story_Category

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want fresh content when I pull to refresh, so that I can get the latest stories and clear outdated cache.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN user executes Pull_To_Refresh, THE Story_Cache_System SHALL invalidate cache for the currently displayed Story_Category
2. WHEN user executes Pull_To_Refresh, THE Story_Cache_System SHALL remove all cached items for the active Story_Category
3. WHEN user executes Pull_To_Refresh, THE Story_Cache_System SHALL preserve cache data for the inactive Story_Category
4. WHEN user executes Pull_To_Refresh, THE Story_Cache_System SHALL fetch fresh data from network
5. WHEN user executes Pull_To_Refresh, THE Story_Cache_System SHALL repopulate cache with fresh data after successful network response

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the cache to stay synchronized with my browsing, so that all loaded content is available for quick access.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN user scrolls and triggers Pagination_Load, THE Story_Cache_System SHALL add newly loaded items to the appropriate Story_Category cache
2. WHEN user loads additional pages, THE Story_Cache_System SHALL maintain cache consistency with displayed content
3. THE Story_Cache_System SHALL append new items to existing cache without replacing previously cached items
4. THE Story_Cache_System SHALL update cache immediately after successful pagination network responses
5. THE Story_Cache_System SHALL maintain correct item ordering in cache matching the display sequence

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the app to handle cache efficiently, so that memory usage remains optimal and performance stays smooth.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Story_Cache_System SHALL store cache data in memory for fast access
2. THE Story_Cache_System SHALL implement efficient data structures for cache storage and retrieval
3. THE Story_Cache_System SHALL provide cache hit/miss tracking for performance monitoring
4. THE Story_Cache_System SHALL handle cache operations without blocking the UI thread
5. THE Story_Cache_System SHALL gracefully handle cache failures by falling back to network requests
