# Privacy Policy for HackerNewsPulse

**Last Updated: 10/26/2025**

## Introduction

HackerNewsPulse ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and safeguard information when you use our mobile application (the "App").

## Information We Collect

### Information We DO NOT Collect

HackerNewsPulse is designed with privacy in mind. We do **NOT** collect, store, or transmit any personal information, including but not limited to:

- Personal identification information (name, email, phone number)
- Device identifiers or advertising IDs
- Location data
- Usage analytics or tracking data
- User accounts or login credentials
- Personal preferences or settings (stored only locally on your device)

### Information We Access

The App only accesses:

- **Hacker News Public API**: We retrieve publicly available news stories and content from the Hacker News API (https://hacker-news.firebaseio.com/)
- **Internet Connection**: Required to fetch news content and open external links
- **Local Device Storage**: For temporary caching of news stories to improve app performance (stored locally on your device only)

## How We Use Information

### Local Data Processing

- **Caching**: News stories are temporarily cached on your device to provide faster loading and offline access
- **Performance Optimization**: Local storage is used to improve app responsiveness and reduce network usage
- **No Data Transmission**: All cached data remains on your device and is never transmitted to our servers or third parties

### External Links

When you tap on news story links, the App uses Chrome Custom Tabs to open external websites. This functionality:
- Opens links within the app for a seamless experience
- Does not track or monitor your browsing activity
- Follows the privacy policies of the respective websites you visit

## Data Storage and Security

### Local Storage Only

- All app data is stored locally on your device
- No data is transmitted to external servers (except for fetching public Hacker News content)
- Cached content is automatically managed and may be cleared when storage space is needed

### Data Security

- We implement appropriate technical measures to protect locally stored data
- No sensitive personal information is processed or stored
- The App uses secure HTTPS connections when communicating with the Hacker News API

## Third-Party Services

### Hacker News API

The App fetches content from the official Hacker News API. This service:
- Provides publicly available news stories and comments
- Does not require user authentication
- Follows Hacker News' own privacy practices

### Chrome Custom Tabs

When opening external links, the App uses Chrome Custom Tabs, which:
- Is a system-level feature provided by Google Chrome
- Follows Google Chrome's privacy policy
- Does not share your browsing data with our App

## Children's Privacy

HackerNewsPulse does not knowingly collect any information from children under the age of 13. The App is designed to access only publicly available news content and does not require any personal information input.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected by updating the "Last Updated" date at the top of this policy. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.

## Data Retention

- **Local Cache**: Cached news stories are automatically managed by the App and may be cleared based on device storage needs
- **No Server Data**: Since we don't collect personal data on servers, there is no server-side data retention

## Your Rights and Choices

Since we don't collect personal information, there are no personal data rights to exercise. However, you can:
- Clear the app's cache through your device's app settings
- Uninstall the App to remove all locally stored data
- Control internet access permissions through your device settings

## International Users

HackerNewsPulse can be used worldwide. Since we don't collect personal data, international data transfer regulations don't apply to our App's core functionality.
